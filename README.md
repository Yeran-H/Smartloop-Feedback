## Capstone Project

The SmartLoop Feedback application is the focus of Yeran Hettiarachchy's capstone project, designed to transform feedback delivery in education through the use of AI technology. Traditional feedback methods often suffer from delays and lack of personalization, making it difficult for students to address their unique learning needs. SmartLoop addresses these challenges by offering personalized, real-time feedback that helps students track their progress, understand their strengths and weaknesses, and actively improve their performance.

The application simplifies the feedback process for educators, allowing more time for focused teaching and student mentorship. This capstone project highlights how AI can enhance student engagement, improve learning outcomes, and streamline feedback delivery, benefiting both students and teachers in an evolving educational landscape.
